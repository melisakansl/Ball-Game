## HW-2

Please reimplement the code in `bouncingballs.py` file into the `HW2.py` file according to the requirements below. Make sure that the game is **running properly** and all requirements are satisfied **at the same time**.

1. The code must utilize as much **object oriented concept** as possible.
   1. Make sure that all data is in objects;
   2. Make sure that "data encapsulation" is never broken;
   3. Make sure that public interface of classes are as small as possible. _Hint: implement a `Game` class to handle game related functions. You can add more classes if you think its needed._
2. There should be 5 balls in different sizes, speeds (inter move times), and initial positions. You don't need to consider ball-to-ball interactions.
3. The balls must stop if they slow down too much.
